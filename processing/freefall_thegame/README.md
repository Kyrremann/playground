Freefall the Game
=================

Freefall the Game is about a freefalling pixel just wanting to land. Can you help it avoid the obstacles and steer it to the ground?

Controllers
===========
Two players can play, one steer with 'left', 'right', 'up' to reduce speed, and 'down' to gain speed.  and the second player steers with 'a', 'd', 'w', and 's'.

TODO
====
* ~~Controller for the second player~~
* ~~Intro and menu~~
* ~~"Game Over" window, but still let the other player continue~~
* Smoother controllers
* Levels/difficulty
* ~~Remove the boxes that get painted outside the player area~~
* ~~Paint the pixel on both side when you are close to the edge~~
* Let a second player just "jump" into a game
* Some background around the "areas" the game is playing on
* Support other resolutions
* Highscore (maybe connect it to the GM Scoreboard)
* Paralaxing background in the playing area
* A ~~much~~ *slightly* better level generator
* ~~Replay?~~
* Let the user choose a pixel (stats?color?size?)
* Implement physics, so when the pixel bumps into another pixel it will bounce
* Splatter effect when the pixel crashes head on with another pixel
* Bonuses and boosts, maybe collectables?
  * Freeze time
  * Bonus points
  * Destroy all pixels
* Story mode!
  * Need to save the prince in the other pixel-tower
* Music
* Night and day cycle
* Weather (wind?)
* Bosses
* Weapons
* Destroyer-mode; The pixel should try to crash as many of the other pixels as possible (score on crash and comboes)
* Bonus for nearly crashes and avoidances
* Rainbow mode, every pixel changes color
* Horizontal-mode; Instead of falling, the pixel is floating horizontal
