ASETNIOP: The typing game
-------------------------

This is a simple game that will (hopefully) learn you the strange keyboard layout called
[ASETNIOP](http://asetniop.com/). Check out their website if you want to learn more. I made this game so I could have a
fun use for my cool Ginni keyboard from [gBoards.ca](https://www.gboards.ca/product/ginni).

If you have a Ginni you can download and flash the layout using
[chinatus](https://github.com/chinatsu/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/ginni) QMK fork. Going to clean up the
firmware code before we ask to get it merged into the main QMK repo (that would be really cool!).

## How to play

If you have [LÃ–VE](https://love2d.org/) installed on your compute, you probably know what to do (`love .`), for other
people you can download the binaries from the
[release-page](https://github.com/Kyrremann/asetniop-typing-game/releases).

## Credits

Thanks to who ever made ASETNIOP, and thanks to [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/) for the great free and open game
